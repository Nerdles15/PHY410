Need to compute the series f(n)=f(n-1)^2, with f(0)=2; what is the maximum n value that can be stored
in the following C++ data types, assuming that an int is 2 bytes, a long int is 4 bytes (same as unsigned),
and each byte is 4 bits?

for reference: f(0)=2, f(1)=4, f(2)=16, f(3)=256, f(4)=65536, f(5)=4294967296
**I'm assuming that, unless noted, the int/long int values are signed**

a) int -> the largest number you can store as an int in a 4-bit architecture is 127 (2 bytes, 8 bits total; range -128,127),
so the largest value of n for our series is then n=2.

b) long int -> the largest number you can store as a long int in a 4-bit architecture is 32767 (4 bytes, 16 bits total;
range -32768,32767), so the largest value of n for our series is then n=3.

c) unsigned long int -> the largest number you can store as an unsigned long int in a 4-bit archetecture is 65535
(4 bytes, 16 bits total; range 0,65535), so the largest value of n for our series is then n=3.
